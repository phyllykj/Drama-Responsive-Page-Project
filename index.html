<h2>What is Applied Theatre?</h2>
<p>Applied theatre refers to the use of theatrical forms in non-traditional theatre spaces to explore issues of interest and concern to communities. International research has validated the effectiveness of applied theatre techniques in shifting attitudes and behaviours. </p>

  <div> 
    Applied Theatre processes:
<ul> 
  
   <li>  Engage students and teachers in meaningful dialogue about the issues under discussion;</li>
<li> Facilitate a safe environment whereby students can engage both cognitively and affectively with the material;</li>
<li>Provide a stimulus for an ongoing exploration of the issue rather than a one-off hit (and miss);</li>
<li>Provide fully interactive theatre processes that engage students in theatre making themselves.</li></p>
</ul>

<h3>How can an Applied Theatre intervention support children in an educational institution?</h3>

<p> Applied Theatre offers a multimodal approach to learning that invites children to feel safe, confident and motivated to explore new areas of knowledge. In this creative environment, students will discover new parts of their own identity and connect with others, the curriculum and the world around them. Applied Arts can provide an inclusive environment connecting all types of learners from a variety of linguistic and cultural backgrounds to their learning material. </p>

  <h3>About me</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>I have been a facilitator of drama and theatre in education for 12 years. I ran a drama education franchise for babies and young children in the UK for five years before moving to KL, Malaysia to help establish the same programme with local teachers in local schools and kindergartens. After completing an MA in Applied Theatre from RSCCD London and delivering performing arts in education to children in East London primary schools, I moved to Barcelona, Spain where I am currently developing my own drama education programme.   </p>

  <h3>About this website</h3>
    <hr>
  <p>I created this website for a project and to start a conversation over how we can support children with a wide variety of cultural backgrounds and learning styles to connect to their learning material in the traditional classroom environment. Also to provide invaluable social and emotional skills needed for finding balance and stability in the modern world and encouraging the longevity of the child's creative spirit</p>
