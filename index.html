  <h3>About me</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>I have been a facilitator of drama and theatre in education for 12 years. I ran a drama education franchise for babies and young children in the UK for five years before moving to KL, Malaysia to help establish the same programme with local teachers in local schools and kindergartens. After completing an MA in Applied Theatre from RSCCD London and delivering performing arts in education to children in East London primary schools, I moved to Barcelona, Spain where I am currently developing my own drama education programme.   </p>

  <h3>About this website</h3>
    <hr>
  <p>I created this website for a project and to start a conversation over how we can support children with a wide variety of cultural backgrounds and learning styles to connect to their learning material in the traditional classroom environment. Also to provide invaluable social and emotional skills needed for finding balance and stability in the modern world and encouraging the longevity of the child's creative spirit</p>
